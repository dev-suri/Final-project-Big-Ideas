**Based on our findings, we determined that the following ten neighborhoods were the best in Pittsburgh:**
\n
#1 Squirrel Hill South
#2 Highland Park
#3 Squirrel Hill North
#4 Regent Square
#5 New Homestead
#6 Swisshelm Park
#7 Point Breeze
#8 Allegheny West
#9 Mt. Oliver Neighborhood
#10 Mount Oliver Borough

This answer was determined by three metrics: number of arrests / crimes, number of trees / greenery, and number of road / traffic incidents.

The formula representation of this metric was: **-0.75** * _num_arrests_ **+ 0.25** * _num_trees_ **- 0.25** * _num_road_incidents_.
